As the population ages, the problem of nursing care is becoming more serious.
The problem of caregiving is only getting worse, in part because of the lack of staffing and poor treatment of caregivers.

In Japan, where the aging of the population is high and issues are advanced, there are examples of cutting-edge initiatives that utilize IoT devices for nursing care and create state-of-the-art user interfaces to achieve both high efficiency labor savings and service improvements.

SCOP NOW was born to solve the nursing care problem by developing a common API that does not deteriorate the efficiency even if the number of IoT sensors increases.

We will connect all IoT devices in this SCOP NOW and invite peers to solve social problems.
